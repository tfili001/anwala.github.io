Hi Janet:

 

Happy to make your acquaintance. We have a contract role open (3-6 months) and could go permanent as a Technical Support Analyst which pays $20/hour. They would need to be onside during our core hours of 8:30-5:30 M-F.

 

Additionally, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Developer – this full-time/permanent role might be better suited for graduate students or alumni.

 

Job descriptions with application links are attached.

 

Thanks for spreading the word!

 

Tracy

I can certainly help spread the word. If you send me a job posting/description with skills needed, and whether or not it is a paid opportunity, I will share it with the undergraduates. Is it an internship – or full-time employment for the foreseeable future?

Subject: Potential Opportunities for CS Students with Leesa Mattress

 

Hi Ms. Brunelle,

 

I want to introduce you to Tracy from Leesa Mattress, whose cc'ed on this email. They're a local company that sells mattresses entirely through their website and they've had some tremendous success in doing this. They've been growing fast and are looking to bring in more local talent to their company and that includes computer science students from ODU. I told her that you would be the person to go to to help with finding candidates since you're always sending out potential job opportunities to students.

 

Best,

Michael Freeman II

Dear Timothy,

Effective May 1st, 2018 the convenience fee associated with credit/debit card payments on the billing portal will increase from 2.75% to 2.85%. Consider using the electronic checking option to avoid the convenience fee. All you need to successfully submit an electronic check is the routing number, account number, and billing address associated with your checking account. The easiest way to obtain and verify this information would be to refer to a paper check. Please see the example below:


DO NOT submit an electronic check with information from a credit card convenience check, money market account, or a savings account as it will be returned. Student accounts will be charged a $50 returned check fee if a check payment is returned. NO EXCEPTIONS will be made in waiving a returned check fee. Should you have any questions please call the Student Accounts Team at 757-683-3030. You can also stop by the Student Accounts Office located on the 1st floor of Rollins Hall. Have a good day Monarchs and finish the semester strong!
Sincerely,
Delores White
Director of Student Accounts
