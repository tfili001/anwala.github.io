Hi Janet:

 

Happy to make your acquaintance. We have a contract role open (3-6 months) and could go permanent as a Technical Support Analyst which pays $20/hour. They would need to be onside during our core hours of 8:30-5:30 M-F.

 

Additionally, we are looking for a Senior Frontend Developer – this full-time/permanent role might be better suited for graduate students or alumni.

 

Job descriptions with application links are attached.

 

Thanks for spreading the word!

 

Tracy

I can certainly help spread the word. If you send me a job posting/description with skills needed, and whether or not it is a paid opportunity, I will share it with the undergraduates. Is it an internship – or full-time employment for the foreseeable future?

Hi Ms. Brunelle,

 

I want to introduce you to Tracy from Leesa Mattress, whose cc'ed on this email. They're a local company that sells mattresses entirely through their website and they've had some tremendous success in doing this. They've been growing fast and are looking to bring in more local talent to their company and that includes computer science students from ODU. I told her that you would be the person to go to to help with finding candidates since you're always sending out potential job opportunities to students.

 

Best,

Michael Freeman II
