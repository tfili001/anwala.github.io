Good Morning Janet –
 
I wanted to extend a personal invitation to the College of Sciences Student Ambassador Reception on April 20th at 3p in the VA Beach/Portsmouth Room (Webb Center). One of your graduating seniors, Michelle Flanagan will be recognized during the ceremony and it would be great to have you in attendance! More information on the ambassador program can be found at the link below.
 
If you’re unable to make it, no worries. Just let me know J
