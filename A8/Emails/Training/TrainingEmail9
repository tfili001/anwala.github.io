Dear Timothy, 

It is not too late to join the Senior Class Challenge.  Give your gift of $20.18 today to help a fellow Monarch and receive your Philanthropy Honor Cord to wear to graduation.

Your gift of $20.18 will go towards the ODU Student Concordia Scholarship, the scholarship for students by students.
The Class of 2017 Fall Graduates raised $3,149.86.  Can the Class of 2018 top it?
