TONIGHT! Lending contemporary flair to mainstream stylings, Thiroux carries on the hard-swinging tradition of bass masters Ray Brown and John Clayton while channeling the vocal finesse of iconic singers Ella Fitzgerald and Chet Baker. Thiroux offers in-the-moment jazz drawing on the genreâ€™s rich history, from swing to bebop and beyond. Cash bar opens at 7 p.m. Doors open at 7:30 p.m.
