IMPORTANT TIP: If this URL was temporarily unavailable or entered with a typographical error. Your browser takes shortcuts to perform faster. And rather than check the tiny.cc site to verify if link has changed since its last use - the browser assumes it has not... grabs a previously written copy then redirects using your computer's local storage - bypassing tiny.cc servers.
In other words it will keep repeating the same error over and over, until you clear your cache.
